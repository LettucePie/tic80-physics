# tic80-physics
A Physics Demo made on TIC80 (Ruby Lang)

It's Cartridge can be run [here, on tic80's website](https://tic80.com/play?cart=3336)

## Setup

Simply [download TIC80](https://github.com/nesbox/TIC-80) and the cart.tic file. TIC80 has terminal-like file browsing built into it, which you could use to navigate to the cart.tic file. If you don't wish to do that however, you should be able to drag and drop the tic file onto your TIC80 executable, or even into a running TIC80 window.
